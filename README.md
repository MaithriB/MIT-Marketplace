E-commerce has become a game-changer in today's quick-paced world. People now frequently use online marketplaces to buy and sell goods and services without having to leave their homes. The goal of the MIT Marketplace project is to develop a web-based market that is tailored to the requirements of the college campus community. The MIT Marketplace will ease the exchange of goods and services among the campus community by creating a platform that enables students, teachers, and staff to do so effortlessly.
The MIT Marketplace provides a user-friendly interface for buying and selling goods and services. It is developed using HTML, CSS and Django. The website includes features such as user registration and login, product listings, product search, and messaging between users. The marketplace matches the needs and characteristics of students in the campus environment.
